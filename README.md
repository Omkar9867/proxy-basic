# Proxy FD

A simple proxy server to let other devices on your local network access the internet using your system's IP address.

## How it works

- Start the proxy server on your machine.
- Find your system's IP address.
- Set this IP and the proxy port on other devices connected to the same network.

Now, those devices will route their requests through your machine.
